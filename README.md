# CT-Image Segmentation using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Approach
The repository contains the source code and the report of the project of fitting an Active Shape Model of human femur to multiple CT scans of human legs using a MCMC. The project was carried out as a part of the "Probabilistic Shape Modelling" course at the University of Basel (2018 Spring semester).

The source code is under /src/ directory. Report.pdf is the paper of the project.
